Hey everyone,
I’ve built a small side project called sshare.dev – a minimalist, fast, and secure URL shortener.
It uses well-defined cuid logic for generating unique, collision-resistant short IDs. No tracking, no bloat – just a clean API that works. Despite being a hobby project, it's now handling around 1,000 shortened URLs daily.
✅ Highlights:

Free to use
Fast response time via a lightweight API
Secure ID generation with cuid
No ads, no user tracking
Simple, reliable shortening – just the essentials
Alfred Workflow

I’ve also made an Alfred workflow to integrate it into your Mac productivity flow.
Usage:
Copy any URL
Open Alfred, type short, hit Enter
The shortened URL is copied to your clipboard
It’s great if you share links frequently and want something private and snappy.

Happy to get feedback or suggestions. Cheers!
